# 🐢 Tranquil Turtle

**Tranquil Turtle** is a minimalist productivity application built with **WPF in C#** using the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architectural pattern.  
Its goal is to help users block distractions temporarily and encourage mindful breaks using a calming visual aid.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ App blocking timer with countdown  
- 🐢 Turtle image for a calming effect

- 🪟 Unclosable window during timer (only minimizable)  
- 🔁 Automatic return to the main screen after time ends  
- 🧭 Separated views and presenters for clean logic

## 🛠 How It Works

- 1️⃣ Run the app as Administrator (required to close other apps)
- 2️⃣ Enter the name of the application you want to block (e.g., chrome, discord, etc.)
- 3️⃣ Select the desired blocking time from the dropdown
- 4️⃣ Click "Block App" to begin the session
- 5️⃣ A new window opens with a countdown and a focused turtle
- 6️⃣ While the countdown is active, the selected app will remain closed
